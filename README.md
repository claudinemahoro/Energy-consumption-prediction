# Energy-consumption-prediction
 Appliances energy consumption prediction for a low-energy house.

Energy consumption in households is a significant concern due to its usage that we can not 
delay and its cost that sometimes change and we need to adjust our consumption accordingly. 
As one of the basic needs at household level, predicting it accurately can help household in 
planning for it accordingly and take measure for minimizing the consumption; it can also help 
energy suppliers in decision making. This study aims at developing an optimum and accurate
machine learning model that can be used in predicting energy consumption in households. 
The study is based on data collected from one low-energy household for the period of 5 
months on a 10 minutes frequency basis. The dataset used is made of 19735 entries recorded 
over those 5 months period, and 28 variables temperature and humidity data from inside the 
house and weather data from a nearby airport station. In doing this study, we first did some 
data preprocessing, then we tried to explore the dataset through exploratory data analysis
and after we build some regression models and did some dimensionality reduction and 
feature selection to try to optimize the performance of models built. For evaluating the 
models built we used different the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute error
(MAE) and R-squared metrics.
